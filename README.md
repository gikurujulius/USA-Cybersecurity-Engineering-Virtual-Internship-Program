              TASK 1: PROTECT THE KEYS TO THE KINGDOM
              
The target is to review the client’s security by identifying areas we can improve their security posture. One of the vital areas is ensuring that there are strong passwords that comply with their password policy on their critical systems. 
To achieve this goal, we will, 
1.	Review the current passwords and identify those that are not deemed to be strong.
2.	Review the client’s password in relation to their password policy and determine which users are complaint and those that are not.
3.	Provide information on what NIST recommends for handling digital identities.

	Below are the user credentials.

What do we deem as a strong password? Is a long password deemed as secure or is a more complicated one deemed better? This are all good questions an organization should consider while creating their password policy. Considering NIST guidelines and standards, the length, complexity of the composition and randomly chosen secrets are all factors that determine the strength of a password. If you are not aware of NIST, it is an agency responsible for developing information security standards and guidelines. A combination of uppercase, lowercase, symbols, numbers and 8+ characters are deemed stronger. Comparing this to the above users’, some passwords are not strong enough. This includes users, Othy1935, Hustry, Laine1948 just to name a few. 
In this step we will determine the compliant and non-compliant users in regard to the client’s password policy. Regarding the password construction requirements, the passwords meet all the guidelines but one. The passwords must meet a minimum requirement of 12 characters on all systems, this Is not displayed in all passwords. For instance, Othy1935 and Sartury.
			        	Recommendation
After proper review of the passwords and security policy the following usernames did not meet the password requirements. Thfuld51, Heach1976, Sartuary, meman1989, Asaing, Laine1948, Hime1979, and Nessichared. Strict adherence to the password policy is recommended for secure passwords and systems.
